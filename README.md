# Duplicacy CLI (Cron)

This project was started when any single duplicacy CLI docker container couldn't appropriately fit my needs.

The aim of this project is to have cron enabled in order to perform backups from multiple locations to multiple different storages, without the hassle of spinning up several docker containers.

In order to approach a higher reliability, a script is left in `/etc/periodic/daily` per duplicacy location is created. The locations have been selected as well in order to minimize RTO (Recovery Time Objective).

The location examples are primarily meant for UnRAID users, but they can be tailored to fit your needs.

The logs are configured to be available for tracking with `docker logs CONTAINER_NAME`.

## Set-up

### Configuration files

Execute this script per configured location:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
MY-LOCATION=...
MY-DESTINATION=...
MY-SECOND-DESTINATION=...
SMB_NFS_SHARE=...
DISK=...

cd /local_shares/${MY-LOCATION}

duplicacy init -storage-name ${MY-LOCATION}-${MY-DESTINATION} ${MY-LOCATION}-${MY-DESTINATION} /unassigned_devices/${DISK}/${MY-LOCATION}
duplicacy add -bit-identical ${MY-LOCATION}-${MY-SECOND-DESTINATION} ${MY-LOCATION}-${MY-SECOND-DESTINATION} /smb_nfs_shares/${SMB_NFS_SHARE}/${MY-LOCATION}
duplicacy add ...

duplicacy list -storage ${MY-LOCATION}-${MY-DESTINATION}
duplicacy list -storage ${MY-LOCATION}-${MY-SECOND-DESTINATION}
duplicacy list ...
```

Save each script to `/config/${MY-LOCATION}-config.sh` so that you can benefit from having it backed up as well, in case of a future disaster. Execute it before following to the next step. Don't forget to `chmod +x ${MY-LOCATION}-config.sh`.

If something happens during the setup process (With duplicacy, that's a guarantee, for sure) you can safely delete `rm -rf .duplicacy/` on the local folder which is having problems, then re-execute this config file. You could have this in another file called `reinit-folders.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
MY-LOCATION=...
MY-SECOND-LOCATION=...

cd /local_shares/${MY-LOCATION}
rm -rf .duplicacy/

cd /local_shares/${MY-SECOND-LOCATION}
rm -rf .duplicacy/

...
```


### Script files

This is an example of a script file:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
MY_LOCATION=...
MY_DESTINATION=...
MY_SECOND_DESTINATION=...

SHOUTRRR_URL="${SHOUTRRR_URL:-}"

send_notification() {
  if [ -n "$SHOUTRRR_URL" ]; then
    /usr/local/bin/shoutrrr send -u "${SHOUTRRR_URL}" -m "$1"
  fi
}

echo "####################################"
echo "Starting backups for /local_shares/${MY_LOCATION}"
echo "####################################"

cd /local_shares/${MY_LOCATION}

BACKUP_OUTPUT=$(duplicacy backup -stats 2>&1)
BACKUP_EXIT_CODE=$?

if [ ${BACKUP_EXIT_CODE} -eq 0 ]; then
  MSG_BACKUP="âœ… Backup completed successfully for ${MY_LOCATION}"
else
  MSG_BACKUP="ðŸš¨ Backup failed for ${MY_LOCATION}\nCheck logs for more info."
fi

PRUNE_OUTPUT=$(duplicacy prune -keep 0:360 -keep 30:180 -keep 7:30 -keep 1:7 2>&1)
PRUNE_EXIT_CODE=$?

if [ ${PRUNE_EXIT_CODE} -eq 0 ]; then
  MSG_PRUNE="âœ… Prune completed successfully for ${MY_LOCATION}"
else
  MSG_PRUNE="ðŸš¨ Prune failed for ${MY_LOCATION}\nCheck logs for more info."
fi

COPY_OUTPUT=$(duplicacy copy -from ${MY_LOCATION}-${MY_DESTINATION} -to ${MY_LOCATION}-${MY_SECOND_DESTINATION} 2>&1)
COPY_EXIT_CODE=$?

if [ ${COPY_EXIT_CODE} -eq 0 ]; then
  MSG_COPY="âœ… Copy completed successfully from ${MY_DESTINATION} to ${MY_SECOND_DESTINATION}"
else
  MSG_COPY="ðŸš¨ Copy failed from ${MY_DESTINATION} to ${MY_SECOND_DESTINATION}\nCheck logs for more info."
fi

NOTIFY_MESSAGE="${MSG_BACKUP}\n${MSG_PRUNE}\n${MSG_COPY}"

echo -e "${NOTIFY_MESSAGE}"

# Send notification via shoutrrr
send_notification "${NOTIFY_MESSAGE}"
```

Save it to `/etc/periodic/daily/${MY_LOCATION}-script` (NOTE: without `.sh`) within the container to perform daily backups, do not forget to `chmod +x ${MY-LOCATION}-script`. Crontab is already configured thanks to the `busybox-openrc` package. If you want to change the timings for the daily backups, modify at wish with `crontab -e`.
